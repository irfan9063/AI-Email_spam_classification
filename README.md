Email spam classification is the process of identifying and categorizing unsolicited and unwanted emails, known as spam, from legitimate and wanted emails, known as ham. The increasing volume of spam in email inboxes has prompted the development of various spam filtering techniques, including rule-based systems, content-based filtering, and machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms have shown great potential in email spam classification due to their ability to automatically learn and improve from data. These algorithms use statistical models to extract relevant features from the email content and header, such as sender information, subject, and message body. Based on these features, the algorithms can predict the likelihood of an email being spam or ham. Overall, email spam classification plays a crucial role in ensuring that email users receive only relevant and wanted messages in their inbox, while keeping unsolicited and potentially harmful emails out
